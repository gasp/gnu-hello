@cindex greetings
@cindex overview

The GNU @code{hello} program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.
It allows nonprogrammers to use a classic computer science tool which
would otherwise be unavailable to them.  Because it is protected by
the GNU General Public License, users are free (in perpetuity) to
share and change it.

For the latest updates and other information, please visit the GNU
Hello home page at @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/}.

@cindex joke, not
Not to spoil the joke, but of course the practical purpose of GNU
Hello is to serve as a minimal example of a GNU package.  So, although
most manuals don't need to discuss the implementation of the programs
they document, that is part of the goal here.

@cindex GNU coding standards
@cindex GNU maintainer standards
@cindex standards, GNU coding
@cindex standards, GNU maintainer
First, GNU Hello follows the GNU coding standards
(@pxref{Top,,Preface,standards, GNU Coding Standards}) and GNU
maintainer standards (@pxref{Top,,Preface,maintain, Information for
GNU Maintainers}).  These are the basic documents which all GNU
packages should adhere to.

The Hello package also implements recommended development practices
not embodied in the standards, using other GNU packages and features:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@cindex Automake
@cindex Autoconf
It uses Automake (@pxref{Top,,Introduction,Automake,GNU Automake}) and
hence also Autoconf (@pxref{Top,,Introduction,Autoconf,GNU Autoconf})
for configuration.

@item
@cindex Gnulib
It uses Gnulib (@pxref{Top,,Gnulib,gnulib,GNU Gnulib}) to enhance
portability and avoid duplication of common sources.

@item
@cindex Gettext
GNU Gettext (@pxref{Top,,Introduction,gettext,GNU Gettext}) is used
for internationalization support.  Hello's greeting has been translated
into many languages.

@item
@opindex --help
Internally, Hello uses the GNU @code{getopt_long} function
(@pxref{Getopt Long Options,,,libc,GNU C Library}) to parse options,
thus supporting GNU-style long options such as @option{--help}.

@item
@cindex Help2man
Man pages are generated with GNU @code{help2man}
(@pxref{Top,,Overview,help2man,GNU @code{help2man}}) from the
@option{--help} output.  This relieves the maintainers of the burden
of maintaining man documentation separately, yet provides a reasonable
overview for man devotees.

@item
@cindex Texinfo
Finally, Texinfo (@pxref{Top,,Introduction,texinfo,Texinfo}) is the
documentation format for this manual.  It supports output in Info,
HTML, PDF, DVI, plain text, XML, and other formats.

@end itemize

GNU Hello is implemented in C.  GNU Gettext contains ``hello world''
examples in a variety of other programming languages; see the Gettext
home page at @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/}.

@node Sample output
@chapter Sample output

@cindex sample output
@cindex examples

Here are some realistic examples of running GNU @code{hello}.

This is the output of the command @samp{hello}:

@example
Hello, world!
@end example

This is the output of the command @samp{hello --traditional}:

@example
hello, world
@end example

This is the output of the command @samp{hello --greeting=hi}:

@example
hi
@end example


@node Invoking hello
@chapter Invoking @code{hello}

@cindex invoking
@cindex options
@cindex usage
@cindex help

The format for running the @code{hello} program is:

@example
hello @var{option} @dots{}
@end example

@code{hello} supports the following options:

@table @option
@item --greeting=@var{text}
@itemx -g @var{text}
@opindex --greeting
@opindex -g
Output @var{text}.

@item --help
@itemx -h
@opindex --help
@opindex -h
Print an informative help message on standard output and exit
successfully.

@cindex environment variables, help for
For the @option{--help} output of GNU programs, it's strongly
encouraged to include a brief (one or two sentences) description of
what the program does, as well as the synopsis of how to run the
program.  Any environment variables which affect execution should also
be mentioned (Hello doesn't have any).

@item --next-generation
@itemx -n
@opindex --next-generation
@opindex -n
@cindex Unicode
@cindex UTF-8
Output a modern greeting, possibly including box-drawing
characters or other fancy stuff, using the Unicode UTF-8 locale.

@item --traditional
@itemx -t
@opindex --traditional
@opindex -t
@cindex traditional
@cindex modern
Use the traditional greeting message @samp{hello, world} rather
than the more modern @samp{Hello, world!}.

@item --version
@itemx -v
@opindex --version
@opindex -v
Print the version number and licensing information of @code{hello} on
standard output and then exit successfully.

@node Reporting bugs
@chapter Reporting bugs

@cindex bug reporting
@cindex problems
@cindex reporting bugs

To report bugs or suggest enhancements for GNU @code{hello}, please
send electronic mail to @email{bug-hello@@gnu.org}.

@cindex checklist for bug reports
For bug reports, please include enough information for the maintainers
to reproduce the problem.  Generally speaking, that means:

@itemize @bullet
@item The version numbers of Hello (which you can find by running
      @w{@samp{hello --version}}) and any other program(s) or
      manual(s) involved.
@item Hardware and operating system names and versions.
@item The contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug.
@item The expected behavior and/or output.
@item A description of the problem and samples of any erroneous output.
@item Options you gave to @command{configure} other than specifying
      installation directories.
@item Anything else that you think would be helpful.
@end itemize

When in doubt whether something is needed or not, include it.  It's
better to include too much than to leave out something important.

@cindex patches, contributing
Patches are welcome; if possible, please make them with @samp{@w{diff
-c}} (@pxref{Top,, Overview, diff, Comparing and Merging Files}) and
include @file{ChangeLog} entries (@pxref{Change Log,,, emacs, The GNU
Emacs Manual}).  Please follow the existing coding style.
