@cindex how to read
To read this manual, begin at the beginning, reading from left to right
and top to bottom, until you get to the end.  Then stop.  You may pause
for a beer anywhere in the middle as well, if you wish.  (Please note,
however, that The King strongly advises against heavy use of
prescription pharmaceuticals, based on his extensive personal and
professional experience.)

@cindex overview

The GNU @code{hello} program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.
It allows nonprogrammers to use a classic computer science tool which
would otherwise be unavailable to them.  Because it is protected by the
GNU General Public License, users are free to share and change it.

GNU @code{hello} was written by Mike Haertel, David MacKenzie, Jan
Brittenson, Charles Hannum, Roland McGrath, Noah Friedman, Karl
Eichwalder, and @w{The King}.
